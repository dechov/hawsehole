# Hawsehole âš“

React component for navigation and transitions among named anchors.

`npm install --save hawsehole` (or `yarn add hawsehole`)

```jsx
import Hawsehole from 'hawsehole';

<Hawsehole
  // All props optional. Defaults:

  navComponent="nav"  // tag or React component to wrap nav, or null for no nav
  hash={false}  // true to enable read and write URL hash
                // or 'push' to also enable pushState on nav click
  offset={0}  // offset (in px) from anchor top
  currentClassName="current"  // class assigned to prominent anchor in viewport,
                              // and corresponding nav li
  topClassName="top"  // class also assigned to current anchor if at viewport top

  // Scroll transition:
  delay={0}
  duration={(a, b) => Math.pow(Math.abs(a - b), 0.75) + 300}  // (in ms)
  // Note: if function passed for duration or delay, receives scroll position before and after as arguments
  ease={null}  // defaults to D3's default easing

  // Container component:
  component="div"
  className={null}  // Passed along to container
  style={null}  // Passed along to container
